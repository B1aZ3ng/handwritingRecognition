Handwriting Recognition

Img_aug for image augmentation, which will save in training/augmentedWords

training_model for preprocessing and executing the model

training data downloaded from https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database, and should be extracted to FILEPATH, and then replace FILEPATH with the path in all documents

NOTE: the data downloaded is not accessable at least where I am, need to use a vpn to europe for it to work
